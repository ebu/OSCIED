OSCIED-Publisher : The Publication Point
----------------------------------------

OSS Tools
^^^^^^^^^

* Celery_ Distributed Task Queue
* `Apache 2`_ HTTP Server from the Apache Software Foundation
* `H264 Streaming Module`_ from CodeShop

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component is the worker specialized in handling publication tasks. In fact this is *celeryd* daemon that handles the requests and maps tasks to publisher functions calls. This charm's start hook will launch and connect the daemon to the message broker's queue(s) specified in configuration [#pub1]_.

For example, one can choose that the workers running on `Amazon AWS`_ cloud will handle *public* & *low priority* publication requests by setting worker's *rabbit_queues* option to "t_pub,t_low". Then one only need to launch tasks of such kind in one of the defined queues (*t_pub*, *t_low*) and that's it !

Moreover, one can choose to explicitly target a unique worker (e.g. *myWorker2*) by sending tasks to the queue *myWorker2*, this is another interesting feature offered by the application.

Charm's Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can start the charm without specifying any configuration (default values will be used, see :doc:`appendices-publisher`) but I strongly recommend to specify your own values in production !

* **verbose** Set verbose logging
* **concurrency** Amount of tasks the worker can handle simultaneously
* **rabbit_queues** Worker connect to queues to receive tasks
* **max_upload_size** Maximum size for file uploads
* **max_execution_time** Maximum time for PHP scripts
* **max_input_time** Maximum time for HTTP post
* **mongo_connection** Orchestrator database connection [#pub2]_
* **rabbit_connection** Orchestrator message broker connection [#pub2]_
* **storage_ip** Shared storage hostname / IP address (see interface mount of NFS charm) [#pub3]_
* **storage_fstype** Shared storage filesystem type (e.g. NFS) [#pub3]_
* **storage_mountpoint** Shared storage mount point (e.g. for NFS - /srv/data) [#pub3]_
* **storage_options** Shared storage options (e.g. for NFS - rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

.. [#pub1] Add worker's name to queues list, this make possible to launch tasks to this specific worker
.. [#pub2] If all options are set this will override and disable publisher relation
.. [#pub3] If all options are set this will override and disable storage relation

Charm's Relations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Provides : (nothing)
* Requires : Storage [Mount], Publisher [Subordinate]

.. warning::

    The unit's daemon will not start until both conditions are fulfilled :

    * A shared storage is mounted (via the storage relation or by specifying it into configuration)
    * An orchestrator is registered (via the publisher relation or by specifying it into configuration)

Task State Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The orchestrator stores informations about the publication tasks into database in parallel to the informations that Celery_ also stores in. It may seem as duplicate however I choose to do as such for good reasons :

* Additional informations about the tasks can be stored.
* One can choose to replace Celery_ to use any other task queuing technology.
* Listing of tasks is easy to implement, no needs of Celery_'s inspect & filtering.

Celery_'s keep track of tasks and stores informations about tasks into a *backend*, the orchestrator's database (MongoDB_).

    " During its lifetime a task will transition through several possible states, and each state may have arbitrary metadata attached to it. When a task moves into a new state the previous state is forgotten about, but some transitions can be deducted, (e.g. a task now in the FAILED state, is implied to have been in the STARTED state at some point). " [#pub4]_

So, the publication tasks stored in database has a *statistic* field that is filled with values mainly generated by the orchestrator such as *add_date*. The state machine diagram shows what is store in this field plus the values that are appended to task's state metadata.

**Remark:** The orchestrator RESTful API publication methods responses contains task's metadata, appended into *statistic* field.
